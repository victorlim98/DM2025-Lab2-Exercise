      "Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model that are trained on massive amounts of text data to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. They are a subset of the broader field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and are designed to perform a wide range of language-related tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Large Scale:** The \"Large\" in LLM refers to the enormous size of these models, both in terms of the amount of data they are trained on (often billions of words) and the number of parameters (the variables the model learns, often billions or even trillions).\n",
      "*   **Transformer Architecture:** Most modern LLMs are based on the Transformer architecture, which is particularly well-suited for processing sequential data like text. Transformers use a mechanism called \"attention\" that allows the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input when making predictions.\n",
      "*   **Pre-training and Fine-tuning:** LLMs are typically trained in two stages:\n",
      "    *   **Pre-training:** The model is trained on a massive dataset of unlabeled text to learn general language patterns, grammar, and world knowledge. This is often done using a self-supervised learning approach, where the model learns to predict missing words or sentences in the text.\n",
      "    *   **Fine-tuning:** The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned on a smaller, labeled dataset for a specific task, such as text classification, question answering, or text generation.\n",
      "*   **Emergent Abilities:** LLMs often exhibit \"emergent abilities,\" meaning they can perform tasks they were not explicitly trained for. This is thought to be a result of the model's ability to learn complex relationships and patterns from the vast amount of data it is trained on.\n",

      "*   **Question Answering:** Answering questions based on provided text or general knowledge.\n",
      "*   **Summarization:** Condensing long pieces of text into shorter summaries.\n",
      "*   **Text Classification:** Categorizing text into different categories (e.g., spam detection, sentiment analysis).\n",
      "*   **Code Generation:** Writing code in various programming languages.\n",

    "1.  **Trust:** LLMs can \"hallucinate\" or invent information. We need to ensure the extracted data is accurate and comes directly from the source text.\n",
    "2.  **Scalability:** We need a reliable way to extract complex information consistently from thousands of large, messy documents.\n",

    "**`langextract`** is an open-source Python library from Google designed to create trustworthy data extraction pipelines. It uses LLMs to convert unstructured text into structured data with a focus on reliability and traceability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Precise Grounding:** Its core feature. It maps every extracted item to its exact character position in the original text, allowing for easy verification.\n",
    "*   **Reliable Structured Output:** Uses examples (few-shot prompting) to ensure the LLM's output consistently follows a predefined format.\n",
    "*   **Adaptable & No Fine-Tuning:** Can be adapted to any domain (e.g., legal, medical) simply by changing the examples and instructions, without needing to retrain a model.\n",
    "*   **Handles Long Documents:** Built to process lengthy texts that might exceed an LLM's standard context window.\n",
    "*   **Flexible LLM Support:** It is model-agnostic and works with various LLMs like Gemini, OpenAI models, and even local open-source models through Ollama.\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-\ufb01/adventure cinematic \u2018Interstellar,\u2019 \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous \ufb01lms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan\u2019s 2010 \ufb01lm \u2018Inception,\u2019 he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in \u2018Interstellar,\u2019 as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot \u2018Cooper\u2019 (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to \ufb01nd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the \ufb02ick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan\u2019s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n\u2018Brand,\u2019 (Anne Hathaway) and \u2018Romilly,\u2019 (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an in\ufb01nite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly \ufb01nd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to \ufb02y away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the \ufb01lm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to \ufb01nd the \u2018secret to harnessing gravity\u2019 \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive o\ufb00 earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into \u2018Interstellar\u2019 is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scienti\ufb01c depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I \ufb01nd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this \ufb01lm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, \u2018Interstellar\u2019 is a clear example of Nolan\u2019s auteur talent, as he once again \ufb01gments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "\n",
    "Their key advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Contextual Understanding:** Unlike older methods, LLM embeddings are contextual. The vector for a word like **\"bank\"** will be different depending on whether it's used in the context of a \"river bank\" or a \"money bank,\" providing a more nuanced representation of language.\n",
    "\n",

In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",

After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "Performance gradually improves from 50% (0-shot) to 56% (5-shot), but the critical benefit of few-shot prompting is the correction of a severe \"Joy\" bias. While the zero-shot model frequently mislabeled \"Sadness\" as \"Joy,\" providing examples allows the model to calibrate, significantly improving \"Sadness\" detection by reducing false positives. Despite this better balance, all strategies consistently failed to distinguish \"Fear\" from \"Anger,\" indicating that while few-shot prompting resolves polarity confusion (positive vs. negative), it remains insufficient for differentiating semantically similar high-arousal negative emotions."

For this you need to load the results with pandas and handle the data using its dataframe functions. Discuss about the findings."

    "The analysis reveals a critical data pipeline failure rather than a decline in model performance. The reported degradation is artificial; valid predictions in the 0-shot test consistently transition to nan in the 5-shot results. This indicates that providing examples likely altered the model's output format\u2014perhaps by adding conversational text\u2014which caused the extraction script to fail. Consequently, the statistics showing 0% improvement are invalid, and the raw model responses must be inspected to repair the parsing logic before a true evaluation can be made."

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model\u2019s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
