Title: Data Mining and its Origins
Video Segment: 20:00-24:59
========================================

[20:04] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
actually if they're be uncover, then you can find something quite interesting. That is called data mining and we try to look for those unexpected thing.

<<SLIDE_DESCRIPTION>>
The slide shows the definition of Data Mining: "Seeking unexpected 'pearls of wisdom'".

[20:15] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
So origin of the data mining actually come from many, many different place.

<<SLIDE_DESCRIPTION>>
The slide now shows a diagram titled "Origins of data mining" with Data Mining at the center, surrounded by interconnected hexagons labeled: Statistics, Data Warehousing, Database, AI, Machine Learning, and Pattern Recognition.

[20:21] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
Okay, statistic, pattern recognition. You will find out each one of them can become one individual class.

[20:29] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
uh, one individual course, not just class. Like we have machine learning course, we have artificial intelligence course, we have database course, we have data mining course, data warehousing course, statistic, pattern recognition. Each one of them are some course.

[20:45] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
But then, you could you might say that, okay, so if that is the cases, why I need to study data mining? Because we reuse some technique being introduced from those field.

<<SLIDE_DESCRIPTION>>
The slide transitions to a new title: "Why Data Mining?" with the first bullet point: "Traditional techniques may be unsuitable due to".

[21:02] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
Those traditional technology are not suitable because of the data are big enough.

<<SLIDE_DESCRIPTION>>
A new bullet point appears: "Enormity of data".

[21:10] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
Huge. For example, certain statistic methodology is good for not huge data, maybe, or not good for certain data, they have a lot of, so for example, traffic pattern. This is like, um, if you want to our high school right there, you'll find out they have a lot of traffic data right there. In the end, those data will become very enormously.

<<SLIDE_DESCRIPTION>>
An image of a multi-lane highway with cars is added next to "Traffic Patterns".

[21:37] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
And then like cyber security, it will every every information we deliver through the internet will become a piece of information. And but how do you know which action are related to hacker?

<<SLIDE_DESCRIPTION>>
An image of a padlock with a circuit board pattern is added next to "Cyber Security".

[21:52] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
Okay? So you need to do certain mining about that. So cyber security actually is also because you the data is quite large, you need to somehow dig out of them.

[22:04] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
And sometimes it's also because our data have called something we call high dimensionality. Which means dimension is mean like X, Y, Z. X is one dimension, Y is one dimension. But in data mining, we usually have a lot of dimension, thousand or 10,000 or millions of dimension. Why? Because each feature we consider them as a dimension. Each feature as consider as a dimension.

<<SLIDE_DESCRIPTION>>
A new bullet point appears: "High dimensionality of data".

[22:36] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
And so for example, if you want to e-commerce, this is my browsing history on Amazon just in a weekend, I will just try to show that to you.

<<SLIDE_DESCRIPTION>>
An image showing "Your Browsing History" with several book covers is added next to "E-Commerce".

[22:46] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
Every browsing history, you will have a lot of feature, which book you try to check. Okay? Just imagine in those e-commerce store, how many customer, how many books, how many video. Each one of them, if there are one feature, then you can imagine the dimensionality is high enough, like millions or three trillions of the thing right there.

[23:12] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
And sometimes the data mining also try to take care of certain thing we call heterogeneous data.

<<SLIDE_DESCRIPTION>>
A new bullet point appears: "Heterogeneous, distributed nature of data".

[23:19] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
What is called heterogeneous data? So I hope everyone heard of certain thing called IoT, Internet of Thing. Internet of Thing is like we have so many devices all connected through internet.

<<SLIDE_DESCRIPTION>>
An image showing interconnected devices (lightbulb, speaker, camera, etc.) is added next to "IOT".

[23:34] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
Each devices have their own record. Okay? Each device, their own record actually have their own attribute, have different way. So then if you want to somehow try to integrate all the data through the different devices, the data resources come from different place. Also, the data itself might have different type of them. So that is why we call them heterogeneous. You might heard about some other term called homogeneous, which mean if they are the same. All of them they are uniform, they are coming from the same type, they are called homogeneous data. Data mining we try to emphasize on the data might be heterogeneous.

[24:20] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
Okay, so then because of then, you actually as I say, we have so many different courses right there. Okay? Data mining, we try to go through a lot of large data. You might also find out like uh, next semester or in in Tsinghua, we will have another course called data science. If you took that course, you will find out how come a lot of them are the same. Yes, we will have a lot of AI related courses. They cover a lot of thing, they are almost the same in somehow or by maybe maybe like 60% of the thing.

<<SLIDE_DESCRIPTION>>
The slide transitions to a new title: "Different Emphases of Courses". Two bullet points appear: "Data Mining" with a sub-bullet "Pattern discovery in large datasets", and "Data Science" with a sub-bullet "End-to-end data analysis: cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing".
