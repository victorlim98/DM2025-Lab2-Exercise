Title: Data Mining
Video Segment: 20:00-24:59
========================================

[20:04] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
actually if they're be uncover, then you can find something quite interesting. That is called data mining and we try to look for those unexpected thing.

<<SLIDE_DESCRIPTION>>
What is data mining? Seeking unexpected "pearls of wisdom"

[20:15] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
So origin of the data mining actually come from many, many different place. Okay, statistics, pattern recognition. You will find out each one of them can become one individual class.

<<SLIDE_DESCRIPTION>>
Origins of data mining

[20:29] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
Uh what individual course, not just class. Like we have machine learning course, we have artificial intelligent course, we have database course, we have data mining course, data warehousing course, statistics, pattern recognition. Each one of them are some course.

[20:45] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
But then, you could you might say that, okay, so if that is the cases, why I need to study data mining? Because we reuse some technique being introduced from those field.

<<SLIDE_DESCRIPTION>>
Why Data Mining?

[21:02] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
Those traditional technology are not suitable because of the data are big enough. Huge. For example, certain statistic methodology is good for not huge data, maybe, or not good for certain data, they have a lot of, so for example, traffic pattern. This is like, um, if you want to our high school right there, you'll find out they have a lot of traffic data right there. In the end, those data will become very enormously.

<<SLIDE_DESCRIPTION>>
Traditional techniques may be unsuitable due to Enormity of data

[21:37] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
And then like cyber security, it will every, every information we deliver through the internet will become a piece of information. And but how do you know which action are related to hacker? Okay? So you need to do certain mining about that. So cyber security actually is also because you the data is quite large, you need to somehow dig out of them.

Traffic Patterns

[22:04] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
And sometimes it's also because our data have called something we call high dimensionality, which means dimension is mean like X, Y, Z. X is one dimension, Y is one dimension. But in data mining, we usually have a lot of dimension, thousand or 10,000 or millions of dimension. Why? Because each feature we consider them as a dimension. Each feature as consider as a dimension.

High dimensionality of data

[22:36] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
And so for example, if you want to e-commerce, this is my browsing history on Amazon just in a weekend, I will just try to show that to you. Every browsing history, you will have a lot of feature, which book you try to check. Okay? Just imagine in those e-commerce store, how many customer, how many books, how many video. Each one of them, if there are one feature, then you can imagine the dimensionality is high enough, like millions or three trillions of the thing right there.

[23:12] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
And sometimes the data mining also try to take care of certain thing we call heterogeneous data.

<<SLIDE_DESCRIPTION>>
Heterogeneous, distributed nature of data

[23:19] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
What is called heterogeneous data? So I hope everyone heard of certain thing called IoT, Internet of Thing. Internet of Thing is like we have so many devices all connected through internet. Each devices have their own record. Okay? Each device, their own record actually have their own attribute, have different way. So then if you want to somehow try to integrate all the data through the different devices, the data resources come from different place. Also, the data itself might have different type of them. So that is why we call them heterogeneous. You might heard about some other term called homogeneous, which mean if they are the same. All of them they are uniform, they are coming from the same type, they are called homogeneous data. Data mining we try to emphasize on the data might be heterogeneous.

[24:20] <<TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT>>
Okay, so then because of then, you actually as I say, we have so many different courses right there. Okay? Data mining, we try to go through a lot of large data. You might also find out like, uh, next semester or in in Chinghua, we will have another course called data science. If you took that course, you will find out how come a lot of them are the same. Yes, we will have a lot of AI related courses. They cover a lot of thing, they are almost the same in somehow or by maybe maybe like 60% of the thing.
