This is like, um, if you want to our high school right there, you'll find out they have a lot of traffic data right there. In the end, those data will become very enormously.",

Internet of Thing is like we have so many devices all connected through internet. Each devices have their own record. Okay? Each device, their own record actually have their own attribute, have different way. So then if you want to somehow try to integrate all the data through the different devices, the data resources come from different place. Also, the data itself might have different type of them. So that is why we call them heterogeneous. You might heard about some other term called homogeneous, which mean if they are the same. All of them they are uniform, they are coming from the same type, they are called homogeneous data. Data mining we try to emphasize on the data might be heterogeneous.",

You might also find out like, uh, next semester or in in Chinghua, we will have another course called data science. If you took that course, you will find out how come a lot of them are the same. Yes, we will have a lot of AI related courses. They cover a lot of thing, they are almost the same in somehow or by maybe maybe like 60% of the thing.",
