There is\nsome brief sex in it, but the two people involved don’t seem to be\nenjoying themselves. We’re left with a tremendous amount of\ndialogue and very little action. Yet the movie has grossed $950 million\nworldwide and is now the highest-grossing biographical film of all\ntime. It’s also closing in on the highest-grossing ‘R’ rated film of all\ntime (although here in Canada the film is rated PG14). I have to ask:\nHow is $950 million in box office even remotely possible, in a world of\nshortened attention spans and superhero films? \nDon’t get me wrong, I’ve been guilty of a shortened attention span\ntoo from time to time but The Journal recently polled 8,000\nmoviegoers to discover that two hours is the limit for a film’s length\nfor most cinema enthusiasts. Only 12% were interested in three-hour\nmovies. I believe superhero films definitely have their place too, as I\nloved Avengers: Endgame, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man: No Way\nHome (among many others). But I digress. \nRobert Oppenheimer is the hero of this story, and he has been tasked\nwith overseeing the infamous Manhattan Project’s Los Alamos lab in\nNew Mexico during World War II. His team’s mission is to build the\nworld’s first atomic bomb before the Germans do. But make no\nmistake—this is Oppenheimer’s story: every scene is about\nOppenheimer, his decisions, and the repercussions of those decisions\nthat will haunt him for the rest of his life. Viewers who are expecting\na drama about American B29s dropping bombs on two of Japan’s\ncities need to look for another film.  \nWant more content like this?
